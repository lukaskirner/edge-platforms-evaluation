@article{Bonomi2017,
abstract = {When a train passes over bridges, the magnitude of forces and accelerations is altered due to sudden changes in the track stiffness. These forces can change with the variation in operational parameters and are effective particularly in high-speed passenger trains, when studying ride index parameter. In addition, by increasing the speed, old bridge structures could fall into resonance, which has harmful consequences for both bridge and ride comfort index. Moreover, to harmonize the old bridges with the new operational conditions dynamic behavior of the vehicle and ride comfort need to be taken into account. In this paper, coupled vertical and roll vibration of a horizontally curved bridge are considered. During pass over the bridge, acceleration and ride comfort of a passenger vehicle are studied. The eccentric vertical and lateral forces are the major excitation sources in the analysis, an issue that is rarely noticed in the literature. A multi-body model of a normal wagon is built in three dimensions, passing over a horizontally curved bridge. The governing equations of the vehicle-bridge system are written, taking into account the wheel-rail interactions. The major variables are the cant, train speed, track quality, and radius of curvature. The paper studies the effects of the prescribed variables on ride comfort. The results show that track quality and cant have considerable influences on ride comfort index. The ride comfort is improved when the speed is approached to a so-called equivalent speed.},

@article{Premsankar2018,
abstract = {The amount of data generated by sensors, actuators, and other devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) has substantially increased in the last few years. IoT data are currently processed in the cloud, mostly through computing resources located in distant data centers. As a consequence, network bandwidth and communication latency become serious bottlenecks. This paper advocates edge computing for emerging IoT applications that leverage sensor streams to augment interactive applications. First, we classify and survey current edge computing architectures and platforms, then describe key IoT application scenarios that benefit from edge computing. Second, we carry out an experimental evaluation of edge computing and its enabling technologies in a selected use case represented by mobile gaming. To this end, we consider a resource-intensive 3-D application as a paradigmatic example and evaluate the response delay in different deployment scenarios. Our experimental results show that edge computing is necessary to meet the latency requirements of applications involving virtual and augmented reality. We conclude by discussing what can be achieved with current edge computing platforms and how emerging technologies will impact on the deployment of future IoT applications.},

abstract = {— Single Page Application (SPA) is composed of individual component that can be replaced or updated independently, without refreshing whole page so that the entire page does not need to be reloaded on each user action, which saves bandwidth as well as no loading of external files every time when page is loaded, such as images or CSS files, etc. The purpose behind this is to make the subsequent page loads very fast as compared to traditional Request-Response cycle. SPA's written by using JavaScript, HTML5, AJAX are getting the likes of developers to build their web applications and some frameworks like AngularJS which are built on top of the JavaScript are making the life of developers very easy. The idea behind using AngularJS in web application is to make your web application modular and easy to maintain. AngularJS brings MVC (Model View Controller) capability to your application. After using minified and compressed files in your application, the size reduces to some KBs which will results in faster loading of pages.},

@article{Song2017,
abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging as part ofthe infrastructures for advancing a large variety of applicationsinvolving connection of many intelligent devices, leadingto smart communities. Due to the severe limitation on thecomputing resources of IoT devices, it is common to offloadtasks of various applications requiring substantial computingresources to computing systems with sufficient computingresources, such as servers, cloud systems, and/or data centersfor processing. However, the offloading method suffers fromthe difficulties of high latency and network congestion in theIoT infrastructures. Recently edge computing has emergedto reduce the negative impacts of these difficulties. Yet, edgecomputing has its drawbacks, such as the limited computingresources of some edge computing devices and the unbalancedload among these devices. In order to effectively explorethe potential of edge computing to support IoT applications,it is necessary to have efficient task management in edgecomputing networks. In this paper, an approach is presented toperiodically distributing incoming tasks in the edge computingnetwork so that the number of tasks, which can be processedin the edge computing network, is increased, and the qualityof-service (QoS) requirements of the tasks completed in theedge computing network are satisfied. Simulation results arepresented to show the improvement of using this approach onthe increase of the number of tasks to be completed in the edgecomputing network.},

abstract = {With the advent of the Internet of Everything, emerging application scenarios including autonomous driving, immersive games based on VR or AR technology, and Industrial Internet of Things have promoted the early development of edge computing technologies. At present, the global mobile communications industry is moving towards 5G. Since 5G is one of the key access technologies to promote large-scale deployment of edge computing, it has made edge computing gain unprecedented attention in the world. However, since the birth of edge computing, edge computing security has been a key issue restricting its implementation and development. The new features of edge computing, the integration of a large number of new technologies, the new application scenarios brought by edge computing, and people's increasing demands for privacy protection have brought great challenges to edge computing security. This paper reviews the current research status of research on edge computing security. By analyzing the security challenges of edge computing in the context of new models, new application scenarios and new technology environments, this paper points out the security problems of edge computing in five aspects, including access control, key management, privacy protection, attack mitigation and anomaly detection. The paper separately discusses the research achievement of the academic community in these five areas and analyzes their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, combining edge cloud collaboration and edge intelligence, the future development direction of edge computing security is discussed and prospected.},

Developers with innovative ideas for new Internet services no longer require the large capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about overprovisioning for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus wasting costly resources, or underprovisioning for one that becomes wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover, companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get results as quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1,000 servers for one hour costs no more than using one server for 1,000. {\textcopyright} 2010 ACM.},

However, the selection of a standard and effective messaging protocol is a challenging and daunting task for any organisation because it depends on the nature of the IoT system and its messaging requirements. Copious messaging protocols have been developed and employed by various organisations based on their requirements in the last two decades. Though, none of them is able to support all messaging requirements of all types of IoT systems. Messaging protocol is an ongoing dilemma for the IoT industry; consequently, it is important to understand the pros and cons of the widely accepted and emerging messaging protocols for IoT systems to determine their best-fit scenarios. Therefore, this paper presents an evaluation of the four established messaging protocols MQTT, CoAP, AMQP and HTTP for IoT systems. Firstly, it presents the broad comparison among these messaging protocols to introduce their characteristics comparatively. Afterwards, it performs a further in-depth and relative analysis based on some interrelated criteria to gain insight into their strengths and limitations. Thus, based on this detailed evaluation, the user can decide their appropriate usage in various IoT systems according to their requirements and suitability.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates a large number of heterogeneous and pervasive objects that continuously generate information about the physical world. These objects, through standard communication protocols and unique addressing schemes provide services to the final users or systems. IoT is envisioned to bring together billions of devices, also denoted as smart objects, by connecting them in an Internet-like structure, allowing them to communicate and exchange information and to enable new forms of interaction among things and people. Given the distributed nature of IoT applications, it is often the case that the application is modeled, developed and tested on each compute node, and connected to other nodes in the application network for achieving the end result. Therefore the deployment of application is also, more or less, done on each individual compute node. In this paper we propose an approach where the IoT application can be modeled in one place, where after modeling, the different pieces of application are annotated with location information, and based on this annotation, the application is decomposed into fragments that are deployed to corresponding individual compute nodes, automatically generating code to remotely connect the application fragments to other application fragments on other compute nodes in the edge or in the cloud.},

abstract = {In the last few years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as the new disruptive technology to change the world. Cloud computing has accompanied this field to overcome its processing and storage limitations. However, this evolution has originated a huge increase in IoT devices and data that will create a bottleneck for current networks, in addition to a lack of low latency in cloud communications. Edge computing has been developed to address this challenge, moving the processing to the edge of the network. In this paper, an edge computing architecture is presented to overcome these challenges. The architecture, based on our previous work on the $\lambda$-CoAP architecture, covers the whole vision of an edge computing deployment, from IoT devices, to the edge Smart Gateways and up to a cloud infrastructure.},

abstract = {Many enterprise IoT application scenarios, such as connected cars, smart cities, and cloud-connected industrial plants require distributed MQTT brokers to achieve high scalability and availability. With a market of over 20 MQTT brokers, it is hard for software architects to make a good selection. Existing MQTT comparisons often include only non-distributed brokers, focus exclusively on performance, or are difficult to generalize. We compared three distributed MQTT brokers for performance, scalability, resilience, security, extensibility, and usability in an enterprise IoT scenario deployed to an edge gateway cluster. We found that EMQX provided the best performance (28K msg/s), while only HiveMQ showed no message loss in our test scenario. VerneMQ offers similar features as the other brokers but is fully available as open source. The paper includes decision guidance for software architects, listing six major decision points regarding MQTT brokers.},

What these devices offer is tamper response, the capability to detect any attacks on their surface and securely delete the sensitive content stored in their memory. Such devices are manufactured to meet specific criteria [e.g. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)] and must be appropriately managed throughout their whole lifecycle. Together with encryption algorithms, cryptographic functions and vendor provided functionalities, they host one or more cryptographic keys that respond to automated or manual commands. Physical security and key management are essential in order to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the keys and these requirements are properly described in various standards. Due to the specific functionality of HSMs, there have been many published attacks via the command interface, which reinforces the need for adequate controls, both physical and logical, around these devices.},

Building these new IoT applications is not an easy task however. Two key challenges are supporting the dynamic nature of the edge network and the context-dependent characteristics of application logic. In this paper we report our experience in building an edge computing platform called Distributed Node-RED (DNR) that uses a distributed data flow programming model based on the popular open source Node-RED tool. We describe some of the challenges we faced as well as some novel solutions that were implemented in our platform. A new approach in applying the concept of exogenous coordination is also presented and shown to be necessary in building large-scale IoT applications across the edge, fog and cloud.},

Where connectivity was required, a zoned architecture was adopted, with firewalls and/or demilitarized zones used to protect the core control system components. The adoption and deployment of ‘Internet of Things' (IoT) technologies is leading to architectural changes to IACS, including greater connectivity to industrial systems. This paper reviews what is meant by Industrial IoT (IIoT) and relationships to concepts such as cyber-physical systems and Industry 4.0. The paper develops a definition of IIoT and analyses related partial IoT taxonomies. It develops an analysis framework for IIoT that can be used to enumerate and characterise IIoT devices when studying system architectures and analysing security threats and vulnerabilities.

abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {While the IoT deployments multiply in a wide variety of verticals, the most IoT devices lack a built-in secure firmware update mechanism. Without such a mechanism, however, critical security vulnerabilities cannot be fixed, and the IoT devices can become a permanent liability, as demonstrated by recent large-scale attacks. In this paper, we survey open standards and open source libraries that provide useful building blocks for secure firmware updates for the constrained IoT devices-by which we mean low-power, microcontroller-based devices such as networked sensors/actuators with a small amount of memory, among other constraints. We design and implement a prototype that leverages these building blocks and assess the security properties of this prototype. We present experimental results including first experiments with SUIT, a new IETF standard for secure IoT firmware updates. We evaluate the performance of our implementation on a variety of commercial off-the-shelf constrained IoT devices. We conclude that it is possible to create a secure, standards-compliant firmware update solution that uses the state-of-the-art security for the IoT devices with less than 32 kB of RAM and 128 kB of flash memory.},

abstract = {The various types of communication technologies and mobility features in Internet of Things (IoT) on the one hand enable fruitful and attractive applications, but on the other hand facilitates malware propagation, thereby raising new challenges on handling IoT-empowered malware for cyber security. Comparing with the malware propagation control scheme in traditional wireless networks where nodes can be directly repaired and secured, in IoT, compromised end devices are difficult to be patched. Alternatively, blocking malware via patching intermediate nodes turns out to be a more feasible and practical solution. Specifically, patching intermediate nodes can effectively prevent the proliferation of malware propagation by securing infrastructure links and limiting malware propagation to local device-to-device dissemination. This article proposes a novel traffic-aware patching scheme to select important intermediate nodes to patch, which applies to the IoT system with limited patching resources and response time constraint. Experiments on real-world trace datasets in IoT networks are conducted to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed traffic-aware patching scheme in alleviating malware propagation.},

abstract = {Self-control and autonomy are not guaranteed when people age and are in need of help from others, especially in institution-based housing. This occurs despite the fact that it is a generally accepted belief that care should be delivered with the greatest possible degree of independence and autonomy. This article discusses older people's experiences with and the opportunities for autonomy in institution-based housing. Through focus group interviews and observations, the daily lives of residents at two nursing homes in Sweden were studied through a comparative approach using the theoretical framework of organizational culture. Three themes emerged showing how autonomy was not a reality for the residents. The first theme revealed an ambivalent mission, indicating ambiguity as to whether the nursing home was a place to live in or a place in which to be cared for. The second theme was symbolic power, which encompassed the staff's power embedded in the organization. The third theme was the ageist approach to care, which was noted in the way staff considered the residents to be old people who were unable and unwilling to strive for autonomy. The three themes were embedded in the organizational culture and were created and recreated in the interaction between residents and staff. A key question for further research is how to change the culture to strengthen the residents' autonomy. {\textcopyright} 2014 Copyright Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Cloud computing has accompanied this field to overcome its processing and storage limitations. However, this evolution has originated a huge increase in IoT devices and data that will create a bottleneck for current networks, in addition to a lack of low latency in cloud communications. Edge computing has been developed to address this challenge, moving the processing to the edge of the network. In this paper, an edge computing architecture is presented to overcome these challenges. The architecture, based on our previous work on the $\lambda$-CoAP architecture, covers the whole vision of an edge computing deployment, from IoT devices, to the edge Smart Gateways and up to a cloud infrastructure.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), also called the Internet of Everything or the Industrial Internet, is a new technology paradigm envisioned as a global network of machines and devices capable of interacting with each other. The IoT is recognized as one of the most important areas of future technology and is gaining vast attention from a wide range of industries. This article presents five IoT technologies that are essential in the deployment of successful IoT-based products and services and discusses three IoT categories for enterprise applications used to enhance customer value. In addition, it examines the net present value method and the real option approach widely used in the justification of technology projects and illustrates how the real option approach can be applied for IoT investment. Finally, this article discusses five technical and managerial challenges.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) now permeates our daily lives, providing important measurement and collection tools to inform our every decision. Millions of sensors and devices are continuously producing data and exchanging important messages via complex networks supporting machine-to-machine communications and monitoring and controlling critical smart-world infrastructures. As a strategy to mitigate the escalation in resource congestion, edge computing has emerged as a new paradigm to solve IoT and localized computing needs. Compared with the well-known cloud computing, edge computing will migrate data computation or storage to the network 'edge,' near the end users. Thus, a number of computation nodes distributed across the network can offload the computational stress away from the centralized data center, and can significantly reduce the latency in message exchange. In addition, the distributed structure can balance network traffic and avoid the traffic peaks in IoT networks, reducing the transmission latency between edge/cloudlet servers and end users, as well as reducing response times for real-time IoT applications in comparison with traditional cloud services. Furthermore, by transferring computation and communication overhead from nodes with limited battery supply to nodes with significant power resources, the system can extend the lifetime of the individual nodes. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey, analyzing how edge computing improves the performance of IoT networks. We categorize edge computing into different groups based on architecture, and study their performance by comparing network latency, bandwidth occupation, energy consumption, and overhead. In addition, we consider security issues in edge computing, evaluating the availability, integrity, and the confidentiality of security strategies of each group, and propose a framework for security evaluation of IoT networks with edge computing. Finally, we compare the performance of various IoT applications (smart city, smart grid, smart transportation, and so on) in edge computing and traditional cloud computing architectures.},

More specifically, we study three usage scenarios and optimize our fog computing platform for them. These usage scenarios are: (i) content dissemination in challenged networks, (ii) crowd-sourced fog computing, and (iii) programmable Internet-of-Things analytics. We leverage and enhance open source projects to realize our fog computing platform.We then solve optimization problems in each usage scenario with novel algorithms. Sample results show that our proposed algorithms outperform baseline algorithms by at least 30.3{\%}, 20.0{\%}, and 89.4{\%} in terms of the main performance metrics of the three usage scenarios, respectively. Several ongoing tasks aim to improve our fog computing platform for: (i) network resource provision, (ii) system dynamics adaption, and (iii) device availability prediction.},

abstract = {A software supply chain attack occurs when a cyber threat actor infiltrates a software vendor's network and employs malicious code to compromise the software before the vendor sends it to their customers. The compromised software then compromises the customer's data or system. Newly acquired software may be compromised from the outset, or a compromise may occur through other means like a patch or hotfix. In these cases, the compromise still occurs prior to the patch or hotfix entering the customer's network. These types of attacks affect all users of the compromised software and can have widespread consequences for government, critical infrastructure, and private sector software customers.

abstract = {When it comes to storage and computation of large scales of data, Cloud Computing has acted as the de-facto solution over the past decade. However, with the massive growth in intelligent and mobile devices coupled with technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), V2X Communications, Augmented Reality (AR), the focus has shifted towards gaining real-time responses along with support for context-awareness and mobility. Due to the delays induced on the Wide Area Network (WAN) and location agnostic provisioning of resources on the cloud, there is a need to bring the features of the cloud closer to the consumer devices. This led to the birth of the Edge Computing paradigm which aims to provide context aware storage and distributed Computing at the edge of the networks. In this paper, we discuss the three different implementations of Edge Computing namely Fog Computing, Cloudlet and Mobile Edge Computing in detail and compare their features. We define a set of parameters based on which one of these implementations can be chosen optimally given a particular use-case or application and present a decision tree for the selection of the optimal implementation.},

abstract = {Demanding IoT application requirements such as high dependability and low latency, cannot be satisfied by centralized cloud computing when deploying these applications. Edge computing is emerging as an alternative to deploy demanding IoT applications closer to the edge of the network. However, with edge computing, available resources are distributed among different resource-constrained devices, which cannot host large monolithic applications. We propose a new hierarchical IoT application model, suitable for the distributed nature of edge computing. Thus, a task in the application is modeled using multiple configurations of smaller tasks, each with their own functionality level and resource requirements. For deployment we use a decentralized resource technical framework that finds a satisfiable task mapping on edge devices. Its functionality is inspired by an auction house, having the objectives of (i) deploying an application such that its requirements are met and (ii) empowers edge devices to be in control of their available resources. For the latter, we propose a new decision policy to help edge devices take better decisions regarding the use of local available resource. Our solution enables efficient device resource utilization when deploying IoT applications at the edge.},

@article{Bisu2018,
abstract = {In this work, a precise method for measuring end-to-end (E2E) latency in satellite Internet Protocol (IP) networks is proposed. Latency (i.e., time delay) is considered a key parameter that affects the quality of service (QoS) and the performance of communication systems. This is more pronounced in the IP over Satellite. Metrics such as throughput and bandwidth performance of communication systems are dependent on latency, which also has a direct impact on other QoS metrics, such as Internet packet transfer delay and delay variation (or jitter). The upper limits of QoS objective performance metrics are defined by E2E latency for different QoS traffic classes in this environment. Therefore, there is a need to develop efficient methods for the accurate measurement of E2E latency in a satellite IP environment. Two case study scenarios were developed for satellite heterogeneous networks to measure the latency in a satellite IP network. Two geostationary satellite network services were used to compare the performance of the different scenarios and networks. The results demonstrate that at least 50{\%} of the E2E latency is due to the processing and transmitting of IP packets over the satellite in both scenarios. Inconsistent latency behaviour was also observed from daily results at different times of the day, which may degrade performance of jitter sensitive applications.},

abstract = {Almost every use case and every connected device focused on by the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) requires some sort of compute capability at its source, at the edge. Multiple sources define edge computing as " cloud computing systems that perform data processing at the edge of the network, near the source of the data " . While this is certainly true, it only scratches the surface of the immense power and remarkable capabilities that edge computing applications and architectures can provide to solve industrial internet users' toughest challenges. But, as is typical with any powerful technology, innovative architectures and new terminology are needed to facilitate implementation, bringing increased complexity with it. Purpose and Audience This white paper provides practical guidance on edge computing, architectures and the building blocks necessary for an edge computing implementation. It defines edge computing architectural functions and highlights key use case considerations Consequently, there is a need to identify:  where the edge is,  its defining characteristics,  key drivers for implementing edge computing and  why compute capabilities should be deployed at the edge in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems. It also informs architecture and testbed teams through:  identifying and evaluating standards, practices and characteristics best suited for addressing edge computing holistically, and highlighting gaps where needed,  identifying deployment models and crosscutting functions that address patterns and characteristics for edge computing deployment and  exploring and identifying extensions to the current edge computing model that expand and enhance the functionality of edge computing devices. Several detailed use cases are highlighted, edge computing for industrial analytics is explored and security challenges for edge computing implementations are also considered. (Detailed security information from the IIC can be found in the Industrial Internet Security Framework. 1)},

@article{Wang2018,
abstract = {The Internet of Things is a novel paradigm with access to wireless communication systems and artificial intelligence technologies, which is considered to be applicable to a variety of promising fields and applications. Meanwhile, the development of the fifth-generation cellular network technologies creates the possibility to deploy enormous sensors in the framework of the IoT and to process massive data, challenging the technologies of communications and data mining. In this article, we propose a novel paradigm, 5G Intelligent Internet of Things (5G I-IoT), to process big data intelligently and optimize communication channels. First, we articulate the concept of the 5G I-IoT and introduce three major components of the 5G I-IoT. Then we expound the interaction among these components and introduce the key methods and techniques based on our proposed paradigm, including big data mining, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. In addition, an experimental result evaluates the performance of 5G I-IoT, and the effective utilization of channels and QoS have been greatly improved. Finally, several application fields and open issues are discussed.},

abstract = {In today's market, where rival web services compete for attention, a well-designed REST API is a must-have feature. This concise book presents a set of API design rules, drawn primarily from best practices that stick close to the Web's REST architectural style. Along with rules for URI design and HTTP use, you'll learn guidelines for media types and representational forms. REST APIs are ubiquitous, but few of them follow a consistent design methodology. Using these simple rules, you will design web service APIs that adhere to recognized web standards. To assist you, author Mark Mass{\'{e}} introduces the Web Resource Modeling Language (WRML), a conceptual framework he created for the design and implementation of REST APIs.},

abstract = {The evolution of the Internet to an ubiquitous computing environment where massive amounts of devices will be connected. Sharing, receiving and acting upon data has brought in a problem of security. There are as many firmware and software update procedures as there are manufacturers. Therefore it would be good if a common solution could be found. We looked for suitable mechanisms in the past three years, to be used in Internet of Things networks as well as an up and coming research and standardization work. Our findings show that there indeed are good options for firmware update mechanisms that use state-of-The-Art technologies to deliver updates in a secure manner. While not all the mechanisms were specifically targeting deployment scenarios found in the Internet of Things, we still believe the concept of such update mechanism is suitable also for IoT use and thus can be adapted trivially to IoT networks and devices. We also propose a generic four-element model for secure firmware updates.},

@inproceedings{Dutta2012,
abstract = {Enterprise clouds today support an on demand resource allocation model and can provide resources requested by applications in a near online manner using virtual machine resizing or cloning. However, in order to take advantage of an on demand resource model, enterprise applications need to be automatically scaled in a way that makes the most efficient use of resources. In this work, we present the SmartScale automated scaling framework. SmartScale uses a combination of vertical (adding more resources to existing VM instances) and horizontal (adding more VM instances) scaling to ensure that the application is scaled in a manner that optimizes both resource usage and the reconfiguration cost incurred due to scaling. The SmartScale methodology is proactive and ensures that the application converges quickly to the desired scaling level even when the workload intensity changes significantly. We evaluate SmartScale using real production traces on Olio, an emerging cloud benchmark, running on a kvm-based cloud testbed. We present both theoretical and experimental evidence that comprehensively establish the effectiveness of SmartScale. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},
