\chapter{Aim of work}
The goal of this work is to compare and evaluate edge computing platforms based on predefined evaluation criteria. In order to be able to evaluate the platforms as accurately as possible, an implementation of a specific use case is given. For a representative result, the structure and the content of the system should be identical if possible. Subsequently, the result is evaluated and presented on the basis of predefined evaluation criteria, which partly arise from the problem definition.
