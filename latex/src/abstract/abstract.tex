\chapter*{Abstract}
Internet of Things devices get rapidly more and more integrated in our daily life. In fact, the number of IoT devices are expected to almost triple until 2030. Also, cloud computing experienced a wide adoption over the past years. Today, many IoT devices and the cloud directly communicate with each other. But concerns like privacy, latency or the fear of massive cloud outages can push the computing away from the cloud towards the edge. To operate and manage the edge, the usage of edge computing platforms is recommended. This work evaluates possible open source edge computing platforms on the basis of a use-case implementation. The evaluation is done by a predefined set of evaluation criteria which matches the overall requirements of common edge computing use cases. It is shown that edge computing platforms grant a good start to manage and run applications on the edge. But the edge computing platforms seem to be at the start of their journey and need further adjustments to be usable for big fleets of devices. This master thesis is targeted to students of computer science or similar, application developers and infrastructure architects/developers.
